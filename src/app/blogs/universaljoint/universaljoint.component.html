                    Applications</h2>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="all-world">Universal joints, also known as U-joints or universal couplings, are pivotal components in
            the machinery and automotive industries, facilitating the transmission of rotary motion between shafts that
            are inclined to each other. This mechanical connector's ability to allow for varying angles makes it
            indispensable in many applications. In this blog, we will explore the structure, function, and diverse
            applications of universal joints, particularly highlighting the advancements and contributions of RRB
            Bearings in this field.</p>

        <div class="all-uls">
            <h2 class="all-quality">Understanding Universal Joints</h2>
            <ul class="ul-quality">
                <li>
                    <p class="all-world">A universal joint is a mechanical connection between rotating shafts which
                        typically are not parallel but intersect. The basic design of a U-joint allows for shafts to be
                        connected while permitting movement in any direction, which is essential for transferring power
                        through different angles. This joint consists of a pair of hinges located close together,
                        perpendicular to each other, connected by a cross shaft.</p>
